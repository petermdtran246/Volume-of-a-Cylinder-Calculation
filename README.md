# Volume of a Cylinder Calculation
This C++ program calculates the volume of a cylinder using the given parameters: radius (r) and height (h).

## Expression Used for Calculation
The program uses the following expression to calculate the volume of a cylinder:

volume = M_PI*radius*radius*height

Where:
  -  Ï€ is approximately 3.14.
  -  r is the radius of the cylinder.
  -  h is the height of the cylinder.

## Parameters
- r: Radius of the cylinder.
- h: Height of the cylinder.
